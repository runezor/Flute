Please add any other events which it may be useful to count, maybe some CHERI specific events (see below for ARM and Toooba events)
## Riscv Spec
All counters are 64bit registers  
Cycle and retired instruction counters required  
Up to 29 generic counters each with corresponding event selector CSR  
Event 0 is no event, other events defined by platform  
A future revision will define a mechanism to generate an interrupt when a counter overflows
## Arm Spec
64bit cycle counter  
Up to 31 generic counters, either 32 or 64bit  
Flag set and optional interrupt on overflow  
Counters can be written, to allow arbitrary frequency of interrupts  
Many common predefined events, space for custom events

- Common architectural events (possibly less interesting):

## Toooba Events
One counter per event, all events counted  
Counters are `Count#(Data)` from Cntrs package (Data-wide counters)  
'Counter set' or 'overflow interrupt' NOT possible, global 'counter enable'  
Some events are specific to this core and couldn't be used for other cores
